Organize, display & market Matterport property tours & interactive 3D content with your WordPress-based website, on your domain.

== Description ==

Organizing and displaying Matterport, 3D, or other 360 degree tour content can be a bit of a drag. With WP3D, there's an easy way to show off your work on <strong>YOUR OWN WEBSITE</strong>. This plugin makes it easy to build directories of "Models" that you can organize into your own categories. 

Plus, each Model comes with its own primary URL as well as multiple "views".  You can enter your Model data once and choose which "view" ("standard", "fullscreen", "nobrand" or "skinned") to share with potential clients, current clients, local MLS (Multiple Listing Service), etc. Additionally, all Model sharing (on social media, or elsewhere) returns visitors to your site, vs sending them back to the tour provider's site and giving away your valuable SEO credit. Images for Models are dynamically generated from Matterport, ThreeSixty Tours and can be uploaded for other content providers.  These images and then served from your own site for fast display.

WP3D Models version 2+ adds many new content enhancing features to supplement Matterport Models. Each model can now also include image galleries, video, floorplans, agent contacts, related models, custom skinning (single page websites) and so much more! 

WP3D Models version 3+ adds the ability to select various "Model Types" as the base content for each Model.  This makes it possible to create, supplement, and organize single property webpages with nearly any kind of interactive embed, in addition to Matterport-based content.
